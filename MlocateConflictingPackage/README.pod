This is the source file from which the README file is generated.

This file is written in Perl's Plain Old Documentation (POD) format.
Run the following Perl commands to convert it to text or to HTML
for easy reading:

  pod2text README.pod >README.txt

  # pod2html seems buggy, at least in perl v5.10.1, therefore
  # I'm using this long one-liner instead (with bash):
  perl -MPod::Simple::HTML  -e "\$p = Pod::Simple::HTML->new; \$p->index( 1 ); \$p->output_fh( *STDOUT{IO} ); \$p->force_title('mlocate Conflicting Package'); \$p->parse_file('README.pod');"  >README.html

This file is best edited with emacs module pod-mode, available in CPAN.
However, the POD syntax is quite simple and can be edited with a standard text editor.

=head1 I<< mlocate >> Conflicting Package

If you do not use the I<< mlocate >> database, then you probably don't want to pay the associated performance price,
especially on systems with little memory, where updating the database can render the computer unresponsive for a long time.

For more information about the kind of performance problems that the I<< mlocate >> background indexer can cause, take a look at this Ubuntu bug report:

=over

updatedb.mlocate uses 100% of the hdd IO. The OS is completely unusable

L<< https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mlocate/+bug/1190696 >>

=back

The bug is from june 2013, and 4 years later, Ubuntu has not even attempted to mitigate the problem by simply lowering the background indexer's disk priority.

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, remove packages I<< locate >> and I<< mlocate >>, and then install this 'conflicting' package to prevent
them from ever being installed again, as some packages mention I<< mlocate >> as a suggested or recommended dependency. This is one way to do it:

  sudo dpkg --remove locate
  sudo dpkg --remove mlocate
  sudo dpkg -i mlocate-conflicting-package_1.002_all.deb

This 'conflicting' package is not actually a hard, unsurmountable ban, but you should get a conflict warning from your favourite
package manager if something wants to install I<< locate >> or I<< mlocate >> again.

Note that, if you just remove package I<< mlocate >>, then package I<< locate >> will provide an I<< updatedb >> tool that ends up referencing I<< /usr/bin/updatedb.findutils >> instead
of I<< /usr/bin/updatedb.mlocate >>, so you need to remove package I<< locate >> too.
