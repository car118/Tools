See this script's source code for more information. The reason why the emacs server must be running locally is that the generated lisp code needs to open a local temporary file where the piped text is stored."

# About why an emacs server instance must already be running:
#
# The 'emacsclient' tool has an '--alternate-editor' argument that can start a new emacs instance
# if an existing one is not reachable over the server socket. The trouble is, as of version 24.3,
# the new emacs instance is not started with the --eval argument, so this script breaks.
#
# On this web page I found the following workaround:
#   http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient
# If you start emacsclient with argument '--alternate-editor="/usr/bin/false"', it will fail,
# and then you can start emacs with the --eval argument. Caveats are:
# - emacsclient prints ugly error messages.
# - emacsclient does not document that its exit code will indicate a failure if --alternate-editor fails.
# - There is no way to tell whether something else failed.
# - Starting "emacs --eval" is problematic. This script would then wait forever for the new emacs instance to terminate.
#   If emacs were to be started in the background, there is no way to find out if it failed.
# After considering all the options, I decide to keep this script clean and simple, at the cost
# of demanding an existing emacs server. For serious emacs users, that is the most common scenario anyway.
