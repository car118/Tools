# I usually write documentation in POD (Plain Old Documentation) format,
# which is a markup language. You can embeded POD in Perl scripts (.pl files)
# or have separate .pod files.
#
# This script checks that the POD syntax in the given file is OK, and then
# converts the documentation to HTML (in a fixed temporary file) and opens it
# with the standard Web browser. Such automated steps are convenient when
# writing or reading documentation.
#
# You need to install Perl on your system before running this script.
# It uses Perl module Pod::Simple::HTML, which is part of the Perl core modules,
# but still does not get installed together with Perl by default on many distributions.
# On Cygwin, the package is called 'perl-Pod-Simple', and on Ubuntu/Debian 'libpod-simple-perl'.
#
# This should have been a Perl script from the start.
