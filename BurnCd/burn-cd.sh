# CD burning script, version 2.01.
#
# You would normally use an application like Brasero to burn CD-ROMs (or DVD-ROMs, etc).
# But sometimes you need to automate the process, so that it is faster or more reliable.
#
# I found CD burning hard to automate. I hope that this script helps.
#
# Usage:
#
#  ./burn-cd.sh  "Volume label"  "/dir/with/cd/contents"
#
# The steps that the script performs are:
#
# - Build a temporary ISO image with the files in the specified directory.
#
# - Optionally mount the ISO image for manual testing purposes,
#   so that you can see how the CD will look like.
#   You need to edit this script manually in order to enable this step, see below.
#
# - Burn the CD and eject it.
#   By ejecting we make sure that the system is not caching the data in any way.
#
# - Delete the temporary ISO image.
#
# - Close the CD tray and mount the CD.
#
# - Verify the files on the CD by comparing them with the original files (with "diff --recursive").
#
# - Eject the CD once again.
#
# The ISO image filename and the mountpoints used are always the same. They are created
# where this script resides. This should not be an issue, as you can normally burn just
# one CD at a time. This way, if something fails, you known what ISO image file to delete
# and what mountpoint to unmount. Using a temporary file under /tmp for the ISO image could
# leave one such big file behind for every failed run.
#
# Mounting the CD requires sudo privileges. Alternatively, you could enter those commands
# in the system's /etc/sudoers file (always edit that file with 'visudo'). The mount commands
# should not change because the mountpoints used are always the same.
#
# Finding your CD drive:
#
#   The first thing to do before using this script is to find out where your CD burner is located.
#
#   If your drive is at the default location /dev/cdrom , then you do not need to do anything else.
#   Otherwise, you have to find where it is.
#
#   You would normally find this out with "wodim --devices" or "wodim -scanbus", but this fails
#   often in may Linux systems, even though adding a "dev=/dev/xxx" parameter with the right
#   device name does work. To top it all, the device location is usually not clearly displayed anywhere.
#
#   As a work-around, try with any of these commands:
#
#     wodim -v -inq    # print device identification and version information
#     wodim -v -prcap  # like -inq plus detailed capability information
#     wodim -v -checkdrive  # like -inq plus it queries the "driver flags" and "supported modes".
#
#   Normally, CD drives get block device filenames like /dev/sr0, /dev/sr1 and so on. One of them is the default,
#   and is referenced from a few standard filenames with symbolic links like this:
#
#     /dev/cdrom -> /dev/sr0
#     /dev/cdrw  -> /dev/sr0
#     /dev/dvd   -> /dev/sr0
#     /dev/dvdrw -> /dev/sr0
#
#   These devices also tend to get additional character device filenames like /dev/sg0 (sg0 is the first SCSI device).
#
#   Once you have found out which block device name is the right one, set environment variable
#   BURN_CD_SH_DEV_NAME before running this script.
#
#   You would normally set that environment variable in your .bashrc file (or similar) for maximum convenience,
#   because the drive location does not change across reboots.
#   For example: export BURN_CD_SH_DEV_NAME=/dev/my_block_device
#
# Lowering your CD burning speed:
#
#   Some CD burners do not work reliably at the maximum speed (which is the default one).
#   Consider lowering the write speed. The best way is to set environment variable
#   CDR_SPEED, which wodim will honour. You would normally set that environment variable
#   in your .bashrc file (or similar) for maximum convenience.
#
#   For example, my 48x drive writes by default at 22x to 44x, depending on the CD position,
#   on average at 29x. With "export CDR_SPEED=4", it lowers the burning speed to 16x,
#   which is the minimum actually supported by this drive.
#
#   In order to find out what speeds your drive supports, issue a "wodim -v -prcap" command,
#   or look at /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info .
#   If wodim reports the following:
#
#     Number of supported write speeds: 0
#
#   insert a blank CD and try again. This time it should report the supported burning speeds.
#
# Automounter interference:
#
#   If wodim complains like this a few times and then gives up:
#
#     Error trying to open /dev/cdrom exclusively (Device or resource busy)... retrying in 1 second.
#
#   it probably means that your system's automounter has automatically mounted the CD
#   before wodim tried to lock it.
#   Use your desktop environment's file manager to unmount the CD before trying again.
#   In order to prevent this problem, you can disable your system's automounter. Alternatively,
#   do not close the drive tray when you place a blank CD on it, as wodim will automatically
#   close the tray before starting the CD burn process.
