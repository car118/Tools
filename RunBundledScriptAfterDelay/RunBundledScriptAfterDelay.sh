# Copyright (c) 2015 R. Diez - Licensed under the GNU AGPLv3
#
# This tool runs a script with the given command-line arguments after a delay (see 'sleep').
# The script to run needs not be a full path, as this tool will change to the directory where
# it resides before attempting to run the script. Symbolic links are correctly resolved
# along the filepath used to run the tool.
#
# Example:
#
#   /somewhere/RunBundledScriptAfterDelay.sh  0.5s  ./test.sh a b c
#
# That example is equivalent to:
#
#   sleep 0.5s
#   cd "/somewhere"
#   ./test.sh a b c
#
# The main usage scenario is when running a user-defined script from KDE's autostart with a delay.
# If the script does not use a configuration file under the user's home directory, but expects
# to find its data where it is located, this tool helps, as KDE does not properly resolve
# symlinks when running an autostart entry.
#
# KDE autostart HINT: When adding to KDE autostart, leave option "Create as symlink" ticked,
#                     otherwise this script gets copied (!) to some obscure KDE folder, and then the
#                     copy becomes easily stale.
